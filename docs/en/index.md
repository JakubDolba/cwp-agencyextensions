# Developer documentation for CWP agency extensions

This codebase is referred to as the "CWP agency extensions" module. It runs alongside your own custom code as well as:

 * SilverStripe CMS (open source CMS product)
 * SilverStripe commercially supported modules (which deliverers many of the default features)
 * Two CWP specific modules (`cwp/cwp` and `cwp/cwp-core`) that implement specific configuration and features related to running websites on CWP

For general information about working with SilverStripe CMS code, please consult the
[Official SilverStripe CMS developer documentation](https://docs.silverstripe.org/). 
We will point developers towards the official documentation when appropriate while ensuring CWP specific development guides are maintained in this documentation.

For information regarding the CWP codebase, please see the [CWP developer documentation](https://www.cwp.govt.nz/developer-docs).

If you are completely new to SilverStripe CMS development, then you might like
to work through the online SilverStripe CMS [development lessons](https://www.silverstripe.org/learn/lessons/) or attend an [in-person introductory workshop](http://www.silverstripe.com/what-we-do/services/training/#jumpstart-course/).
