summary: Information regarding the use of the carousel extension

# Carousel

The carousel extension provides the ability to add a carousel of images and/or text to a Page.

To add the extension, add the following to your YAML configuration (e.g. `_config/config.yml`):

    BaseHomePage:
      extensions:
        - CarouselPageExtension

This will add a "Carousel" tab in the CMS when you edit a BaseHomePage. From here you can manage the slides for your
carousel.

## Templates

For an example of templates for the carousel, please see either the WƒÅtea theme or the "default" theme.
